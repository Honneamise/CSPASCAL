# CSPASCAL

CSPASCAL is a simple PASCAL interpreter written in C#.

It is based on the **"Let's build a simple interpreter"** series found on the RUSLAN'S BLOG web page: ( https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/ )

This project is a kind of playground for learning the C# language.

The code in this repository was created as closely as possible to its original Python version.

The project was made in live streaming on Twitch ( https://www.twitch.tv/drhonny ) from chapter 1 to 19.
